<p>I have talked with my colleagues about using those algorithms in order to choose the destination hosts when scheduling for virtual machines in OpenStack</p>
<p>The below link is only about simulating the flow of how these algorithms work. Their abstractions and reseachs can be easily found on Internet. Here we do not take into account the performance, speed, etc. of algorithm. I just want to simulate the workflow of them.</p>
<p>https://github.com/vietstacker/Bin_packing_algo_flow_simulation</p>
<p>Take it as a funny thing on weekend and hopefully, it opens a new idea about optimizing the scheduling process in OpenStack.</p>
